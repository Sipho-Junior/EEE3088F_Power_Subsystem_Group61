# EEE3088F_Power_Subsystem_Group61 
The micro-mouse project requires the design and development of a compact, efficient, and reliable power subsystem capable of operating autonomously within a constrained embedded system.
This subsystem will be interfaced with the rest of the micro-mouse through a 2x16-pin header and a JST PH connector for the battery, designed to comply with the physical and electrical constraints specified in the project brief.
